# Frontend notes

Frontend notes started as an attempt to create internal notes used by our team at [robusta](http://www.robustastudio.com) to facilitate and improve onboarding of the new frontend developers. After a while I thought I would better share it for the benefits of everyone.

There are tons of useful resources out there covering everything you might want to know. Videos, blogs, magazines, tutorials, discussions on platforms so I am not attempting to reinvent the wheel. My goal is to provide a story telling experience from a prespective of someone who has been working in this field for more than 15 years.

This is a work in progress and I don't think it will ever finish. I will continue to add topics, examples and references for as long as I can. If there is any topic that might be interesting to you please open a GitHub issue and I will add it to the list. You're welcomed to contribute, point to mistakes or request changes to anything you want and I will be glad to discuss.

Thank you.

## Content

The index of the available contents can be found [here](./index.md).

## Flow

Right now I have many drafts with titles and todos that I am willing to continue working on. I will push the parts that I feel they are mature enough to be shared. As I mentioned earlier anyone can suggest a topic and I will put it on my list as long as it falls in the same domain of my work.

Right now I am far away from having a clear structure of this work in my head. I will put the articles in a high-level categories and organize it later as the content grow.
